# ArduinoUltrasonicDistanceSensor
This project uses an Arduino to build an ultrasonic distance sensor system, where LEDs indicate the proximity of an object, and a buzzer sounds an alert when the object is very close. The system is designed to detect objects within a 12-inch range, lighting up different LEDs as the object approaches, with a final alert triggered by the buzzer when the object is within 4 inches. The project involves real-time data processing, sensor integration, and the implementation of algorithms to ensure accurate and reliable readings.

# What I Learned:
- How to integrate and calibrate ultrasonic sensors for precise distance measurement.
- Techniques for smoothing sensor data and reducing noise to prevent false triggers.
- Designing and implementing real-time alert systems using LEDs and buzzers on an Arduino.
